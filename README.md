ðŸ”Ž**Dataset Overview**:
1.Target Variable: The severity of vehicle collisions to enhance the safety of people.

2.Shape: There are 230660 rows and 21 columns in the dataset.

**Data Preprocessing**:
1.Deleted Columns: Dropped  "UNIQUE_ID" ,"COLLISION_ID","PERSON_ID","VEHICLE_ID".

2.Encoding: Co-Ordinal Encoder.

3.Class Imbalance: Used SMOTE technique.

ðŸ“ˆ**Model Evaluation**:
Applied 4 Machine learning Algorithms. "Logistic Regression", "Decision Tree Classifier", "Random Forest Classifier", "Support Vector Machine".

1.Performance: The model with the highest accuracy is Random Forest Classifier .i.e.99.14%.

ðŸŒŸ**Model Success**:
Random Forest Classifier identified the best model for the Accident Severity Prediction.
Effective Preprocessing techniques handled  categorical features, Missing values and Class Imbalance.
