ðŸ”ŽDataset Overview:
Target Variable: The severity of vehicle collisions to enhance the safety of people.
Shape: There are 230660 rows and 21 columns in the dataset.

Data Preprocessing:
Deleted Columns: Dropped  UNIQUE_ID `,`COLLISION_ID,PERSON_ID,VEHICLE_ID.
Encoding: Co-Ordinal Encoder.
Class Imbalance: Used SMOTE technique.

ðŸ“ˆModel Evaluation:
Applied 4 Machine learning Algorithms. "Logistic Regression", "Decision Tree Classifier", "Random Forest Classifier", "Support Vector Machine".
Performance: The model with the highest accuracy is Random Forest Classifier .i.e.99.14%.

ðŸŒŸModel Success:
Random Forest Classifier identified the best model for the Accident Severity Prediction.
Effective Preprocessing techniques handled  categorical features, Missing values and Class Imbalance.
